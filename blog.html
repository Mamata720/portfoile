        <h1>What are soft skills?</h1>
        <p>At a minimum, employees need role-specific knowledge and<br> abilities to perform their job duties. But,
            those who
            usually stand<br> out as high performers need some additional qualities, such as the<br> ability to
            communicate
            clearly, the ability to work well with others<br> and the ability to manage their time effectively. These
            abilities
            are<br> examples of soft skills.</p>
        <p>While it’s difficult to come up with a universal soft skills definition, you can<br> think of them as skills
            that
            are not tied to one specific job; they’re general<br> characteristics that help employees thrive in the
            workplace,
            no matter their<br> seniority level, role or industry. They’re often called transferable skills or
            <br>interpersonal
            skills.
        </p>

        <h1>Why are soft skills important?</h1>
        <p>In job ads, it’s common to include requirements such as “communication skills” or “a<br> problem-solving
            attitude”. That’s because soft skills help you:</p>
        <h3>Identify employees who are not just able to do the job, but they’re also able to<br> do it well.</h3>
        <p>Example: An employee with good time management skills knows how to <br>prioritize tasks to meet deadlines.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose between qualified candidates who meet the typical requirements<br> for the job.</h3>
        <p>Example: When two candidates have a similar academic and professional<br> background, you’re more likely to
            hire the one who’s more collaborative and<br> flexible.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Hire for potential; not just knowledge.</h3>
        <p>Example: For a junior position, it makes sense to look for candidates with a<br> “willingness to learn” and an “adaptive personality”, as opposed to hiring an<br> expert.</p>
        <h3>Make well-rounded hiring decisions.</h3>
        <p>Example: When hiring a salesperson, you want to find a candidate<br> who’s familiar with the industry and has experience in sales, but is also resilient, knows how to negotiate and has excellent verbal communication abilities.</p>

        <h3>Evaluate candidates’ culture fit.</h3>
        <p>Example: If you value accountability and you want to have employees<br> who can take initiative, it’s important to look for candidates who are not<br> afraid to take ownership of their job, who are decisive and have a<br> problem-solving aptitude.</p>
